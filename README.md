This project examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) can identify emotions in song lyrics across various music genres. It uses the Songs_Lyrics dataset, which includes over 160,000 entries containing lyrics, genre, artist, year and song title. The study explores differences in emotional expression by genre as well as how these emotions have shifted over time. For the analysis, the Emotion English RoBERTa Large model is applied, offering a more diversed classification of emotions than standard sentiment analysis. The research also highlights the potential of LLMs to enhance mood detection, sentiment analysis and emotional feedback in AI-driven applications.
